                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Baito is a work schedule and pay tracking app designed for part-time workers. It helps you track shifts, calculate earnings, and manage multiple jobs in one organized place.

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Go to the calendar/list page, click on Add, then on the Add Shift Page click the Quick Import Button at the top, take a screenshot of your work schedule, and upload it. Baito Pro will extract all your shifts automatically.
